# Repository Documentation

![Inputs of the flake, excluding the standard `nixpkgs` and `systems`.](./generated/flake-tree.svg)

Documentation is split into two parts: static and generated. Use the sidebar to
navigate to your desired section or press `s` to search for a keyword.

Generated documentation is preferred over static documentation, as it is
guaranteed to be up-to-date, and can be pruned to only include details relevant
to the specific host it is generated for. For your convenience, globally
applicable and machine-specific pages are separated into their own chapters.
