# Planning

Planning documents for past, present, and future development transcribed from
paper notes when they are in a state that can be worked on and cleaned up.
Still, these are expected to be rough drafts and may contain errors or
incomplete information. Consider them living documents.

- [Activate Mutable](./activate-mutable.md)
- [Nix Server](./nix-server.md)
- [Todo List](./todo-list.md)

## Workflow

Documents are transcribed by taking a photo of the paper notes, then copying the
detected text into a markdown file. Machine transcriptions are very low quality,
so need significant clean up which is done manually.

I prefer paper for initial drafts over digital, as it forces me to think more
about what I'm writing, rather than just dumping my thoughts onto the screen.
Once I'm satisfied with a draft, I'll type a refined version into this
directory, one file per project.
