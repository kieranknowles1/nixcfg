# Planning

Planning documents for past, present, and future development transcribed from
paper notes when they are in a state that can be worked on and cleaned up.
Still, these are expected to be rough drafts and may contain errors or
incomplete information. Consider them living documents.

- [Activate Mutable](./activate-mutable.md)
- [Nix Server](./nix-server.md)
- [Todo List](./todo-list.md)

## Workflow

Documents are transcribed by taking a photo of the paper notes, then copying the
detected text into a markdown file. Machine transcriptions are very low quality,
so need significant clean up which is done manually.
