## Portfolio

My portfolio for job applications listing my projects and skills. As I'm in to
self hosting, it is intended to be hosted on my own server.

### Features

It's a static website. You don't need 566KB of JavaScript\[1\], 82
trackers\[2\], and God knows how many ads to display a simple portfolio.\[3\]
